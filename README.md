# Spring

Spring Framework is a powerful lightweight application development framework used for Enterprise Java (JEE).

The core features of the Spring Framework can be used in developing any Java application. It is described as a complete modular framework. This framework can be used for all layer implementations of a real-time application. It can also be used for the development of a particular layer of a real-time application unlike the other frameworks, but with Spring we can develop all layers.

Spring and all the modules including Spring MVC, Spring Core, Spring Security, Spring ORM, etc are used in enterprise applications.
